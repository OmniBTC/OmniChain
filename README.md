# Polkadot Smart Chain (PSC)

## Polkadot's Parachain
PSC is a Polkadot parachain which uses directly `DOT` as transaction fees and jointly developed by the ChainX team and OmniBTC team.
The ChainX team will build PSC into a cross-chain interoperability hub among the Bitcoin network, Polkadot ecology, EVM ecology, MoveVM ecology, and Cosmos ecology based on technologies such as Zkrollup, XCMP, ibc, and Lightning Network.
The parachain supports EVM/MoveVM/Wasm three contract language programming, supports BTC cross-chain, and will become the Layer2 network of Ethereum.



## Part of OmniBTC liquidity aggregation
[DolaProtocol](https://github.com/OmniBTC/OmniProtocol)  is a chain-wide liquidity aggregation and settlement system with the single coin pool of each public chain as the core, Wormhole, Layerzero and other cross-chain messaging protocols as the bridge, and Sui public chain as the settlement center.

There are `DOT` and assets of each parachain on the Polkadot platform. We will deploy a single currency pool on the Polkadot Smart Chain to become OmniBTCâ€™s liquidity pool site on the Polkadot platform, which is connected to other Polkadot parachains through the XCMP protocol. 
***Committed to allowing the original assets on Polkadot to circulate with mainstream native assets such as BTC/ETH.***

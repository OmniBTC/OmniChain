# OmniChain

## Polkadot's Parachain
OmniChain is a Polkadot parachain jointly developed by the ChainX team and OmniBTC team.
The parachain supports EVM/MoveVM/Wasm three contract language programming, supports BTC cross-chain, and will become the Layer2 network of Ethereum.

## Part of OmniBTC omnichain liquidity aggregation
[OmniProtocol](https://github.com/OmniBTC/OmniProtocol)  is a chain-wide liquidity aggregation and settlement system with the single coin pool of each public chain as the core, Wormhole, Layerzero and other cross-chain messaging protocols as the bridge, and Sui public chain as the settlement center.

There are DOT and assets of each parachain on the Polkadot platform. We will deploy a full-chain single currency pool on the Polkadot parachain OmniChain to become OmniBTCâ€™s liquidity pool site on the Polkadot platform, which is connected to other Polkadot parachains through the XCMP protocol. 
*** Committed to allowing the original assets on Polkadot to circulate with mainstream native assets such as BTC/ETH. ***

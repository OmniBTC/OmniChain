# Polkadot Smart Chain (PSC)
  PSC is an acronym for polkadot smart contract platform. It is an EVM smart contract parachain with DOT as the native Gas fee.

## Polkadot's Parachain
PSC is a Polkadot parachain which uses directly `DOT` as transaction fees and jointly developed by the ChainX team and OmniBTC team.
The ChainX team will build PSC into a cross-chain interoperability hub among the Bitcoin network, Polkadot ecology, EVM ecology, MoveVM ecology, and Cosmos ecology based on technologies such as Zkrollup, XCMP, ibc, and Lightning Network.

## Part of OmniBTC liquidity aggregation
[DolaProtocol](https://github.com/OmniBTC/OmniProtocol)  is a chain-wide liquidity aggregation and settlement system with the single coin pool of each public chain as the core, Wormhole, Layerzero and other cross-chain messaging protocols as the bridge, and Sui public chain as the settlement center.

There are `DOT` and assets of each parachain on the Polkadot platform. We will deploy a single currency pool on the Polkadot Smart Chain to become OmniBTCâ€™s liquidity pool site on the Polkadot platform, which is connected to other Polkadot parachains through the XCMP protocol. 
***Committed to allowing the original assets on Polkadot to circulate with mainstream native assets such as BTC/ETH.***
